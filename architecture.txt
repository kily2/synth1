  Oscillators:
  1. Wavetable Oscillator:
Wavetable oscillators generate sound by cycling through a series of predefined waveforms.

Parameters:

    Octave: A knob/slider to shift the pitch up or down by octaves.
    Fine-Tune: A knob/slider for fine-tuning the pitch.
    Modulation Depth: A knob/slider to control how much modulation affects the wavetable position.
    Modulation Source: A dropdown or button to select the modulation source (LFO, envelope, etc.).
    Modulation Rate: A knob/slider to set the modulation rate.
    Amplitude Envelope: Parameters for controlling the attack, decay, sustain, and release of the sound.

2. Granular Oscillator:
Granular oscillators create sound by playing back tiny grains of audio samples.

    Modulation Depth: A knob/slider for controlling modulation on parameters like grain size and pitch.
    Modulation Source: A dropdown or button to select the modulation source.
    Modulation Rate: A knob/slider to set the modulation rate.
    Amplitude Envelope: Parameters for controlling the envelope of each grain.

3. Fractal Oscillator:
Fractal oscillators generate sound using fractal algorithms, resulting in evolving and complex timbres.

Parameters:

    Fractal Type: A dropdown or selector to choose the type of fractal algorithm.
    Iterations: A knob/slider to set the number of iterations for the fractal generation.
    Modulation Depth: A knob/slider for controlling modulation on fractal parameters.
    Modulation Source: A dropdown or button to select the modulation source.
    Modulation Rate: A knob/slider to set the modulation rate.
    Frequency: A knob/slider to adjust the base frequency of the oscillator.
    Color Mapping: Parameters for mapping fractal values to sound characteristics.
    Amplitude Envelope: Parameters for controlling the amplitude envelope.

4. Physical Modeling Oscillator:
Physical modeling oscillators simulate the behavior of real-world acoustic instruments.

Parameters:

    Instrument Type: A dropdown or selector to choose the type of instrument to model (e.g., string, percussion).
    Excitation: Parameters for controlling how the instrument is excited (pluck, bow, strike, etc.).
    Material Properties: Parameters simulating the physical properties of the instrument (tension, damping, etc.).
    Resonances: Parameters for controlling the resonances and modes of the instrument.
    Modulation Depth: A knob/slider for controlling modulation on physical modeling parameters.
    Modulation Source: A dropdown or button to select the modulation source.
    Modulation Rate: A knob/slider to set the modulation rate.
    Amplitude Envelope: Parameters for controlling the amplitude envelope.

    ======================

  Env\LFO\PB

  Envelope (ENV) Parameters:
Envelopes shape the amplitude of a sound over time, defining how it starts, sustains, and fades out.

Parameters:

    Attack Time: A knob/slider to control how quickly the sound reaches its maximum level after a key press.
    Decay Time: A knob/slider to control the time it takes for the sound to decay from the peak to the sustain level.
    Sustain Level: A knob/slider to set the level at which the sound remains as long as a key is held.
    Release Time: A knob/slider to control the time it takes for the sound to fade out after releasing a key.
    Curve/Shape: A selector to choose between linear, exponential, or other envelope shapes.
    Velocity Sensitivity: A knob/slider to adjust how much the envelope responds to the velocity of the key press.
    Trigger Mode: A selector to choose between single-trigger (restart envelope on each key press) or multi-trigger (allow multiple envelopes to overlap).
    Retrigger: A button/switch to force the envelope to restart when a new note is played before the previous one has finished.

Low-Frequency Oscillator (LFO) Parameters:
LFOs generate periodic waveforms at frequencies below the audible range. They're used to modulate various parameters over time.

Parameters:

    Waveform Selection: A dropdown or selector to choose the LFO waveform (sine, triangle, square, sawtooth, etc.).
    Frequency (Rate): A knob/slider to set the speed at which the LFO oscillates (usually in Hertz or milliseconds).
    Phase Offset: A knob/slider to shift the phase of the LFO waveform.
    Amplitude (Depth): A knob/slider to control the intensity of the modulation applied by the LFO.
    Destination: A dropdown or selector to choose the parameter that the LFO modulates (pitch, filter cutoff, amplitude, etc.).
    Sync: A button/switch to synchronize the LFO rate to the tempo of the music.
    Fade In/Out: Knobs/sliders to control how smoothly the LFO modulation starts and ends.
    Key Sync: A button/switch to reset the LFO phase when a new key is pressed.
    Retrigger: A button/switch to restart the LFO waveform cycle when a new note is played.
